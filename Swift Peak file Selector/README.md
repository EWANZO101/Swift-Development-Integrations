 Welcome to Swift Peak File Selector!
        
        This application provides a user-friendly way to manage files between two folders, offering advantages over the default Windows file explorer.
        
        To use this application, follow these steps:
        
        1. Click on the "Select Folder 1" button to choose the source folder.
        2. Click on the "Select Folder 2" button to choose the destination folder.
        3. Use the file listboxes to view the files in each folder. Unlike the Windows default method, selecting files here will not be affected by scrolling, making it easier to manage large sets of files.
        4. Select the files you want to move by clicking on them. You can also use Ctrl + left-click to select multiple files.
        5. Click on the "Move Selected Files" button to move the selected files from one folder to another.
        
        Happy file selecting!
